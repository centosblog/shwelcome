shwelcome
============

This script prints a friendly welcome message upon a shell login.

It uses a modular approach which allows you to customize/create your own modules. By default it includes the following modules:

* cowsayfortune: prints fortune inside a cowsay bubble
* summary: prints general system info/welcome message
* taskwarrior: prints current task list

### Supported systems

This has been tested on CentOS 6 and OpenSUSE 12, using both BASH and ZSH shells. I'm quite certain it will work on other systems that have BASH 4+ or ZSH 4+ installed.


### Installation

1. Clone this repo to your preferred directory (eg: /opt)

    `cd /opt && git clone https://github.com/centosblog/shwelcome`

2. Ensure shwelcome/shwelcome.sh is executable

    `chmod +x /opt/shwelcome/shwelcome.sh`

3. Individually enable it for your user

    Add `/opt/shwelcome/shwelcome.sh` to your profile file, eg: `~/.bash_profile` (BASH) or `~/.zshrc` (ZSH)

4. (Optional) Enable it globally for all users

    Add `/opt/shwelcome/shwelcome.sh` to your shell's default profile, eg: `/etc/zshrc` (ZSH)


### Installation of Dependencies

1. Enable the EPEL repo (http://www.centosblog.com/enable-epel-repo-on-centos-5-and-centos-6/)

2. Install fortune, cowsay and taskwarrior:

    `yum install fortune-mod cowsay task`
